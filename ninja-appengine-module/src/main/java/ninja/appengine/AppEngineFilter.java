/**
 * 
 * This should be added to all controllers that interact with the GAE.
 * 
 * You can simply add the filter on top of the class
 * 
 * <code>
 * 
 * @FilterWith(AppEngineFilter.class) public class MyController {.... } </code>
 * 
 *                                    This filter ensures that the threadlocal
 *                                    of that controller is populated with the
 *                                    correct ApiProxy bindings for the dev
 *                                    environment.
 * 
 *                                    This also means that in theory this filter
 *                                    is completely useless in the prod
 *                                    environment.
